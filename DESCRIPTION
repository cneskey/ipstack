Description: The 'ipstack' service (<https://ipstack.com/>) offers a powerful, 
    real-time 'IP' to geolocation 'API' capable of looking up accurate location 
    data and assessing security threats originating from risky 'IP' addresses. 
    Tools are provided to query the simple and bulk 'API' query endpoints.
